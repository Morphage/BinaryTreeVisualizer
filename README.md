BinaryTreeVisualizer
====================
Java implementation of Binary Search Trees with only a few select methods such as insert, height, and traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order, level-order). Also included is a function which translates a Binary Search Tree into a valid JSON format which can be passed onto the visualizer.

This was built for the purpose of randomly generating Binary Search Trees, either fully random or balanced, and creating exercises in an XML format, asking for the result of traversing the tree using a particular algorithm.

Java files:

    -BST.java
	
The Binary Search Tree visualizer, coded in Javascript using the JIT library. The files for the visualizer are:

    -binary_tree.js
    
    -binary_tree.html
    
    -various .css files and .js libraries
