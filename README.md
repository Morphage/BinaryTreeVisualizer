BinaryTreeVisualizer
====================
Java implementation of Binary Search Trees with only a few select methods such as insert, height, and traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order, level-order). Also included is a function which translates a Binary Search Tree into a valid JSON format which can be passed onto the visualizer.

Java files:

    -BST.java
	
The Binary Search Tree visualizer, coded in Javascript using the JIT library. The files for the visualizer are:

    -binary_tree.js
    
    -binary_tree.html
    
    -.css and .js files (what do they do?)
   
How to use this visualizer? Write small tutorial TODO!!
