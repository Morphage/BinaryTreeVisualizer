BinaryTreeVisualizer
====================
Java implementation of Binary Search Trees with only a few select methods such as insert, height, and traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order, level-order). In addition, there is a helper function which translates a Binary Search Tree into a valid JSON format which can be passed onto the visualizer.

This was built for the purpose of randomly generating Binary Search Trees, either fully random or balanced, and creating exercises in an XML format, asking the result of traversing the tree using a particular algorithm. (See BSTExerciseGen.java for more info)

Java files:

    -BST.java
    
    -BSTExerciseGen.java
	
Also included is a Binary Search Tree visualizer, coded in Javascript using the JIT library. The files for the visualizer are:

    -binary_tree.js
    
    -binary_tree.html
    
    -various .css files and .js libraries
