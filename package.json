  "description": "BinaryTreeVisualizer ==================== **BinaryTreeVisualizer** consists of a Java implementation to create **Binary Search Trees** and some Javascript code to render these trees in a web page. This API is most useful for applications which have a Javascript capable web-component, with the Java code in the back-end to construct the binary trees, created by user input for instance. I used this API in my final year project (jSCAPE) to provide a visual aid to help students answer exercises on binary search trees.",
